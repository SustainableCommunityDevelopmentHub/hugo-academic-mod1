“As cities become increasingly complex systems with growing populations, they bear the brunt of extreme weather events. Our platform works to increase community awareness so that we can reduce risk together.” -Miho Mazereeuw, director of the Urban Risk Lab and associate professor of architecture and urbanism.

&#8220;Once the reports are generated, we’ll be able to gather information and create a publicly available map in real time [to] allow those who are in flooded areas to travel safely if they need to, and to understand what the risks are around them,” Broward County Mayor Barbara Sharie.

&#8220;The Risk Map project is part of an ongoing collaboration between Broward County and the [MIT Urban Risk Lab][2], which develops methods, prototypes, and technologies to embed risk reduction and preparedness into the design of cities and regions to increase the resilience of local communities. The MIT team aims to expand the map to new counties and add additional social media platforms in the near future.&#8221; &#8211;
