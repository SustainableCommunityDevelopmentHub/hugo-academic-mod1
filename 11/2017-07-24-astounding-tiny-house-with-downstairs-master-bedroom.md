If you don&#8217;t like the idea of climbing into a loft to go to bed, this may be the tiny house design for you. At only 24ft, it&#8217;s amazing what this family have managed to fit into this home. One of the most unique features about this home is the bedrooms, with two available loft areas, this home also has a master bedroom which is located downstairs. 

This tiny house on wheels has everything a young family needs, including full-sized kitchen appliances and even a washer /dryer unit. Best of all, owning the home debt free allows this trio to focus on the things that really matter in life!
