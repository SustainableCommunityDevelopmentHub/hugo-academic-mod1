Cumbria Energy Efficiency Advice Centre is scaling up simple energy efficiency measures throughout Cumbria with an integrated and highly professional service offering advice, funding and insulation. In just two years it has insulated the cavity walls of over 9,000 homes and provided loft insulation for over 5,000 homes, saving 12,500 tonnes of CO2 a year and reducing fuel bills by over £1.6 million a year. CEEAC helps local people who are faced with a bewildering array of grants to make sense of the options and access the right funds for them. One of CEEAC&#8217;s greatest strengths is the stringent management controls it has developed which ensure that contractors carry out work to consistently high standards.
