As a part of SCD Hub&#8217;s ongoing work collecting important &#8216;soft skills&#8217; videos and resources, we take a look at addiction as a human rights issue. Johann Hari&#8217;s important work helps us understand addiction as a symptom of social isolation. If as he states, &#8220;the opposite of addiction is not sobriety, the opposite of addiction is connection&#8221;, then sustainable community development is the only way to really address the modern crisis of opiate, alcohol and sugar addiction in modern society.

What causes addiction? Easy, right? Drugs cause addiction. But maybe it is not that simple.

This video is adapted from Johann Hari&#8217;s New York Times best-selling book &#8216;Chasing The Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs.&#8217; For more information, and to take a quiz to see what you know about addiction, go to [www.chasingthescream.com][1]{.autohyperlink}
