Wood Energy is one of the UK&#8217;s leading wood-fuel heating businesses, providing over a third of the country&#8217;s total wood heat capacity and saving almost 12,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions a year through its boiler installations. Based in Devon, the company helped to set up the UK&#8217;s only accredited wood-fuel training course for the industry to help raise standards. It has also worked hard to ensure a reliable supply of fuel for the heating systems it installs, by supporting local wood-fuel supply businesses and pellet mills. Benefiting from the growing demand for wood-fuel &#8212; which is now cheaper than fossil fuels &#8212; the business is helping the UK meet its carbon reduction targets.
