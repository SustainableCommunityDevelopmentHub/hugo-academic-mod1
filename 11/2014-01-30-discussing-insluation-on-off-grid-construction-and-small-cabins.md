Discussing and showing insulation options for remote and off grid construction projects, which will usually involve small cabins and alternative construction methods. Insulation choices need to take these factors into consideration:
  
The construction project may be located in an area without utilities
  
The place may go for long periods without being temperature controlled
  
The place may suffer environmental damage that goes unnoticed for a long period of time
  
The work crew may not be able to clean clothes and or shower regularly and may be camping on site rather than going home to full utilities at the end of the work day.
  
The resident of the structure may or may not have access to on-call handyman services for repairs, and the place is being built with the expecation of an economic or grid faliure which will mean repairs without the availability of conventional construction materials.
  
The place may not be built all at once, and may be built in different phases over a long period of time by part time construction personnel.
