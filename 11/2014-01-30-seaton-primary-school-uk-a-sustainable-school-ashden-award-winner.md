This video can be downloaded here: [www.ashdenawards.org/winners/seaton][1]{.autohyperlink} Seaton Primary School won an Ashden Award for Sustainable Energy in 2007.

Seaton Primary School in Devon lives out its school motto of &#8216;Caring now for the Future&#8217;, and is one of a few UK schools to install a range of renewable technologies. A 2.5 kW wind turbine and a 4.7 kW PV array on the roof of the school hall supply electricity directly to the school and have helped reduce CO2 emissions by about 2 tonnes a year. In addition, 48 m2 of solar water heating panels heat the school&#8217;s outdoor swimming pool. Other green initiatives include class &#8216;Energy Agents&#8217; to help reduce energy waste; the after-school &#8216;Eco Club&#8217; to monitor energy use; a 2006 Energy Audit resulting in a host of energy efficiency measures; an orchard to provide fruit for pupils and save food miles; and a grey water collection system to supply the school wildlife pond and demonstrate small-scale water power.
