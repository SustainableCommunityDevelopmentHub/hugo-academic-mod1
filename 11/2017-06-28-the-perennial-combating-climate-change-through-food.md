ANTHONY MYINT and KAREN LEIBOWITZ are husband-and-wife co-founders of The Perennial, an award-winning San Francisco restaurant and bar dedicated to making food the delicious solution to climate change. Anthony and Karen co-authored the memoir/cookbook Mission Street Food: Recipes and Ideas from an Improbable Restaurant (2011), and they often work together, though Anthony is primarily a restaurateur whose projects include Mission Chinese Food (SF & NYC), Commonwealth (SF), and Mission Cantina (NYC), and Karen is primarily a food writer who has written for Lucky Peach, Food & Wine, and The New York Times, among other publications. Karen is the co-author, with Dominique Crenn, of Atelier Crenn: Metamorphosis of Taste (2015). Karen is the Director of Communications for The Perennial; Anthony doesn’t have an official title but he’s responsible for dreaming up all the weird environmental projects.
