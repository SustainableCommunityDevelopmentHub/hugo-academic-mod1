Dr. David Western, founder of the African Conservation Centre, gives a lecture titled &#8220;Who Owns Wildlife?&#8221; about the gap among local, national, and global interests related to wildlife preservation. Also, he discusses the mission of the African Conservation Centre: to bring together the people and skills needed to build East Africa&#8217;s capacity to conserve wildlife through sound science, local initiatives, and good governance

About the speaker: Dr. David Western is the founding executive director of African Conservation Centre. Raised in Tanzania and now a Kenyan citizen, he has spent over 37 years engaged in research in Kenya studying the interactions between livestock, wildlife, and humans, with the aim of developing conservation strategies applicable at an ecosystem scale. As former director of Kenya Wildlife Service and conservation director for Wildlife Conservation Society, Dr. Western has been active in many areas of conservation, including community-based conservation, international programs, conservation planning, ecotourism, training, directing governmental and non-governmental organizations, and public education. He and his wife, Dr. Shirley Strum, spend several months each year in California, where Dr. Strum is professor of anthropology at the University of California at San Diego. Their daughter, Carissa, just completed her undergraduate degree at UC San Diego, and their son, Guy, is currently studying at UC Santa Barbara.
