Written and produced by Melissa Mergner in 2006, when she was a 14-year-old high school student, Woody Guthrie &#8212; Voice of the Common Man is a short documentary about how the folk singer-songwriter overcame personal hardship and tragedy to become a spokesman for those Americans affected by the Great Depression and the dust storms. Although neither a politician nor activist, Guthrie brought attention to the plight of Okies, migrant workers and other disenfranchised people. He gave music a social conscience and influenced several generations of singer-songwriters, including Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, Steve Earle, John Mellencamp, Ani DiFranco and Jeff Tweedy. The film uses Guthrie&#8217;s own voice from Library of Congress recordings, as well as archival footage from the &#8217;30s. Soundtrack by Richard Drueding.
