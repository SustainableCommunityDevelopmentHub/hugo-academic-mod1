This video can be downloaded here: [www.ashdenawards.org/winners/solarcentury][1]{.autohyperlink} Solarcentury won an Ashden Award for Sustainable Energy in 2007. 

Solarcentury is a beacon for the UK&#8217;s solar power market, showing how attractive, flexible and easy to install solar PV can be, even in crowded urban areas. The company has used innovative design to develop a range of excellent solar products &#8212; mainly solar PV panels and some solar water heating &#8212; and mounting systems to fit a wide range of buildings, including industrial estates. It has designed and installed 550 solar systems across the country, meeting the rigorous standards of planners as well as clients.

Solarcentury&#8217;s total installed capacity is around 3.3 MWp generating around 2,370 MWh/year which prevents the emission of about 1,350 tonnes of CO2 a year. One of its best known installations is the CIS tower in Manchester with the largest commercial solar façade in Europe.
