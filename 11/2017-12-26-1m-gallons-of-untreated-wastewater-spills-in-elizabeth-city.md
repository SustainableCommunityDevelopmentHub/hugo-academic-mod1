      A NEW PROBLEM OUT OF THIS WEEK&#8217;S RAINS. NOW NEARLY ONE MILLION GALLONS OF UNTREATED AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS WASTEWATER HAS SPILLED IN THIS THAT CHARLES CREEK SECTION OF THE PASQUOTANK RIVER. ABOUT ONE MILLION GALLONS OF WASTEWATER INTO THE STREETS AND A LOCAL CREEK. OFFICIALS SAY IT WAS NOT CAUSED BY BAD TYPES, BUT MOTHER NATURE. THE SEWAGE WATER IS OUT OF THE STREETS. PEOPLE STOPPING BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON SAY THEY ARE NOT GOING BY THE WATER ANYTIME SOON. I THINK IT IS BAD, BUT IF IT IS UNDER CONTROL, THAT IS GOOD NEWS. I DO NOT WANT THEM GETTING IN IT. KNOWING THERE WAS WASTEWATER, THE KIDS WERE NOT GOING TO SCHOOL TODAY. I THINK IT IS GROSS. CITY OFFICIALS SAY PEOPLE DO NOT NEED TO BE CONCERNED. THE VOLUME IN THE PASQUOTANK RIVER IS VERY SMALL, AND IT WAS DILUTED BY RAINWATER. THE OVERFLOW HAPPENED ON SEPTEMBER 21. THE CITY&#8217;S TREATMENT FACILITY WAS OVER ITS CAPACITY. IT IS EQUIPPED TO DEAL UP TO 3 MILLION GALLONS, BUT ON THE 21ST IT SAW BETWEEN 12 MILLION AND 14 MILLION GALLONS OF WATER. THAT IS WHY THEY SOUGHT GOING INTO THE CREEK. IT FLOWED ACROSS THE ROAD, WHEREVER THE RAIN WAS GOING. SOME PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO TAKE CHANCES. MY FIANCE WANTED TO GO FISHING TODAY. WE ARE NOT GOING FISHING. SHE SAID SHE HOPES IT DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. THAT IS A LOT OF SEWAGE.
