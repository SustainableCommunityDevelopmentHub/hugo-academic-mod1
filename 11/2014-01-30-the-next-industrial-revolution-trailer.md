THE NEXT INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION is a new 55 minute film, produced by Earthome Productions to communicate the work and vision of architect William McDonough and chemist Dr. Michael Braungart, two leaders in a growing movement to transform the relationship between commerce and nature. 

McDonough and Braungart work with corporations with over half a trillion dollars in annual sales, companies like Ford and Nike, to redesign buildings, processes, and products to work according to nature&#8217;s rules. 

&#8220;When we follow nature&#8217;s rules, growth is good,&#8221; says Bill McDonough. &#8220;The question before us is not growth versus no growth, It is: what would good growth look like? And this is a question of intent, of design. What if we grow health instead of sickness, home ownership instead of indigence, education instead of ignorance?&#8221; 

Using the stories of five projects that represent a revolutionary change in the direction of the human economy, THE NEXT INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION inspires people to:
  
reconsider their current efforts for the environment,

reinvent their businesses and institutions to work with nature,

redefine themselves as consumers, producers, and citizens to promote a new sustainable relationship with the Earth.

THE NEXT INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION can be purchased in DVD or VHS video formats.

The film is a project of Earthome, a 501(c)(3) Maryland non-profit organization working to promote sustainability and environmental education.
