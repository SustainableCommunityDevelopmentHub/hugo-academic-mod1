song : Bringin&#8217; Home the Rain artist : The Builders and the Butchers album :The Builders and the Butchers 

lyrics: 

Blood-shot, your eyes drop,
  
And the skin&#8217;s all wearin&#8217; thin.
  
There&#8217;s no one here to tell you &#8217;bout the depth of the water,
  
Or the trouble that you&#8217;re in.

You&#8217;re dancin&#8217; with your demons, baby,
  
You forgot your former life.
  
And it was hard swimmin&#8217; once
  
And now you&#8217;re daily divin&#8217; in.

And I&#8217;m bringin&#8217; home the rain
  
There&#8217;s no supper on the table.
  
And my feet are in the flames,
  
I&#8217;m dryin&#8217; out again.

All your kin have all gone on to
  
Fields all bathed in sun.
  
And the only thing left in your possession
  
Is an empty bottle and a gun.

And the weekends come and go like tides
  
And they soak you to the neck.
  
And pretty soon the weekdays
  
Are the same.

And I&#8217;m bringin&#8217; home the rain (I&#8217;m bringin&#8217; home the rain)
  
There&#8217;s no supper on the table. (No supper on the table)
  
And my feet are in the flames,
  
I&#8217;m dryin&#8217; out again.

And I&#8217;m bringin&#8217; home the rain (I&#8217;m bringin&#8217; home the rain)
  
My baby&#8217;s cryin&#8217; in the cradle (Baby&#8217;s cryin&#8217; in the cradle)
  
And my feet are in the flames,
  
I&#8217;m dryin&#8217; out again.

Evil are the demons that haunt you,
  
Forgetting what it was that they taught you.
  
And now there&#8217;s no one left to stop you,
  
Or to catch you when you drop.

You&#8217;re evil as the demons that haunt you,
  
Forgetting what it was that they taught you.
  
And now there&#8217;s no one left to stop you,
  
Or to catch you when you drop.

You&#8217;re evil as the demons that haunt you,
  
Forgetting what it was that they taught you.
  
And now there&#8217;s no one left to stop you,
  
Or to catch you when you, when you, when you&#8217;re&#8230;

Blood-shot, your eyes drop,
  
And the skin&#8217;s all wearin&#8217; thin.
  
There&#8217;s no one here to tell you &#8217;bout the depth of the water,
  
Or the trouble that you&#8217;re in.

You&#8217;re dancin&#8217; with your demons, baby,
  
You forgot your former life.
  
And it was hard swimmin&#8217; once
  
And now you&#8217;re daily divin&#8217; in.

And I&#8217;m bringin&#8217; home the rain (I&#8217;m bringin&#8217; home the rain)
  
There&#8217;s no supper on the table. (No supper on the table)
  
And my feet are in the flames,
  
I&#8217;m dryin&#8217; out again.

And I&#8217;m bringin&#8217; home the rain (I&#8217;m bringin&#8217; home the rain)
  
My baby&#8217;s cryin&#8217; in the cradle (Baby&#8217;s cryin&#8217; in the cradle)
  
And my feet are in the flames,
  
I&#8217;m dryin&#8217; out again.

And I&#8217;m bringin&#8217; home the rain (I&#8217;m bringin&#8217; home the rain)
  
There&#8217;s no supper on the table. (No supper on the table)
  
And my feet are in the flames,
  
Oh, the ceiling&#8217;s&#8230; closin&#8217; in.
