SARIKA BANSAL is an independent journalist who specializes in social innovation and global health. She is a co-director of the Solutions Journalism Network, which supports rigorous and compelling journalism about responses to social problems. Sarika has previously worked in management consulting with McKinsey and in microfinance business development in India. She holds an undergraduate degree in Disease and Public Policy from Harvard College and a MPA from Columbia University&#8217;s School of International and Public Affairs.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.\* (\*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
