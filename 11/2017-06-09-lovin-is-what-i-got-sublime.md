    <p class="verse">
      Early in the morning, risin&#8217; to the street<br /> Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet<br /> Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong<br /> Got to find a reason why my money&#8217;s all gone<br /> I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high<br /> I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot
    </p>
    
    <p class="verse">
      Well, life is too short, so love the one you got<br /> &#8216;Cause you might get run over or you might get shot<br /> Never start no static I just get it off my chest<br /> Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest<br /> Take a small example, take a tip from me<br /> Take all of your money, give it all to charity
    </p>
    
    <p class="verse">
      Love is what I got<br /> It&#8217;s within my reach<br /> And the Sublime style&#8217;s still straight from Long Beach<br /> It all comes back to you, you&#8217;ll finally get what you deserve<br /> Try and test that you&#8217;re bound to get served
    </p>
    
    <p class="verse">
      Love&#8217;s what I got<br /> Don&#8217;t start a riot<br /> You&#8217;ll feel it when the dance gets hot
    </p>
    
    <p class="verse">
      Lovin&#8217;, is what I got, I said remember that<br /> Lovin&#8217;, is what I got, I said remember that<br /> Lovin&#8217;, is what I got, I said remember that<br /> Lovin&#8217;, is what I got, I said remember that
    </p>
    
    <p class="verse">
      Why I don&#8217;t cry when my dog runs away<br /> I don&#8217;t get angry at the bills I have to pay<br /> I don&#8217;t get angry when my Mom smokes pot<br /> Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock<br /> Fuckin&#8217; and fightin&#8217;, it&#8217;s all the same<br /> Livin&#8217; with Louie dog&#8217;s the only way to stay sane<br /> Let the lovin&#8217;, let the lovin&#8217; come back to me
    </p>
    
    <p class="verse">
      Lovin&#8217;, is what I got, I said remember that<br /> Lovin&#8217;, is what I got, I said remember that
    </p>
    
    <p class="verse">
      Lovin&#8217;, is what I got, I said remember that<br /> Lovin&#8217;, is what I got
