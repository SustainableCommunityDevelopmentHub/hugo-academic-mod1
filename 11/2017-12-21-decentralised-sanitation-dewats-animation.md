This video shows how the Decentralised Wastewater Treatment System (DEWATS) works. It is a simple and proven technology to treat organic wastewater.
  
Since it requires no electricity and only little maintenance it can be used to provide marginalized communities with wastewater treatment.

The decentralised wastewater treatment system (DEWATS) is a simple design, non-dependent on energy, reliable, long-lasting, tolerant towards inflow fluctuation, and low in costs. It can treat organic wastewater from domestic and industrial sources. DEWATS is based on different natural water treatment techniques which are combined according to requirements such as the characteristics of wastewater, desired effluent quality and technical specifications.
