Greywater is household wastewater from kitchen sinks and bathroom tubs &#8211; anything except for raw sewage. In many countries in the Middle East and North African region,untreated greywater is used for irrigation purposes due to the environmentally andpolitically determined water scarcity of the region, and is stored in privately constructed holding tanks. Along with risks to human health in the holding and reuse of this water forirrigation, the hiring of private parties to regularly empty these tanks is a cost burden onhouseholds, as public infrastructure is not always available to do so, especially in rural areas. The safe treatment of this water can provide an alternative to other costly andsources of irrigation. But how can this water be treated in a cost effective andsimple way for households to own and utilize? This short film documents the catalyst, innovation, implementation and outcome of onesolution, initially developed in the West bank and now adopted for use in Jordan and Lebanon.
