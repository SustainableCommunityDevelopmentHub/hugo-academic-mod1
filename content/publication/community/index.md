As a community, we seek to create new forms of dialogue and access for community participation input, education, and analysis in order to develop a better context for projects in various communities both real and emergent in support of sustainable human settlement, with peace and peacemaking as its goal throughout our research archive, phone/tablet apps, software tools and clinics SCD Hub represents whenever and wherever that may be.

The type of advocacy that we all want some fun in our life.
