SCD Hub provides one-on-one curating services to clients facing the complex challenges of sustainable community development. 

More specifically, we provide an **interface** in which our clients can easily find vetted information about resources that best match their project needs in an evolving socio-economic and political context. 

Our clients will find a comprehensive list of videos and documents related to the most commonly encountered issues in the planning, design, and execution of community development projects. 

Examples of services include:

&#8211; Creating and facilitating networks of like-minded individuals and organizations around specific issues
  
&#8211; Directing our clients to the most appropriate tools (via videos, documents, team education print outs, etc.) to address their specific project goals, identify indicators of project scalability and long term success.
  
&#8211; Provide recommendations on how to develop a most appropriate community-based project management framework in a specific context and at different scales.
  
&#8211; Developing communication feedback tools and mechanisms to help our clients better deliver services to communities.
