We are in beta and only available on Android.

Look for the SCD Hub in the IOS app store by Aug 8 2017 or so. We seem to be currently in a two week &#8216;name validation&#8217; cycle. No bigdeal.

The hopes we have for the app is initially to have our curated library available for video viewing, and personal learning materials management.

Thank you for the support thus far.
