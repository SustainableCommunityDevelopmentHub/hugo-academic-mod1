SCD Hub&#8217;s support for both traditional and non-traditional learning is an outgrowth of the curation of our video library. The library is a product of Bernard Amadei&#8217;s graduate students contributions while in the [Sustainability in the Built Environment][1] class over a course of 8 years. While available as &#8216;[approvideo.org][2]{.autohyperlink}&#8216; our library has since been used as part of the professional resources [ACME][3] makes available to its members. 

We are now looking at our library with fresh eyes and beginning to build a documents section for files which are particularly insightful about aspects of sustainable community development. Students are vulnerable to huge student debt if they are not careful to win scholarships and work study (coop-ing) opportunities. It is our hope that training resources we offer through our apps and website, email lists, print media, and direct mailings will make a difference in how people are able to prepare themselves for a productive career rooted in sustainable community development technique and technology.

communities are more able to generate wealth, maintain or improve their competitive position, preserve and use community resources and adapt to change (Shaffer, 1989).

Specifically:
  
• An expanded, diverse, inclusive citizen participation base
  
• An expanded leadership base
  
• Strengthened individual skills
  
• A widely shared, understood and agreed local or regional vision for the future
  
• A strategic community agenda (ie a widely agreed strategic plan)
  
• Consistent, tangible progress toward community goals
  
• More effective community organizations
  
• Better use of resources. (adapted from Aspen Institute, 1996)

As we continue to develop our free educational resource library, we are thinking about what content can benefit people the most.
