How can you make sure that when you DO build it, they WILL come? The truth is, you can&#8217;t &#8211; but there&#8217;s a lot you can do to greatly improve your odds. In this workshop, Abby Fichtner, the i-lab&#8217;s Hacker in Residence, walks you through a framework for identifying the right product to build for the right market.

In this highly interactive workshop, you&#8217;ll hear case studies of what other startups have done and try out techniques yourself to help you craft your own strategy for:
  
&#8211; Finding a problem worth solving
  
&#8211; Deeply understanding your customer
  
&#8211; Finding a solution that resonates
  
&#8211; Knowing what to launch

Watchers can plan to walk away with some pragmatic guidance you can put to use immediately.
